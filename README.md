# Motion-Tomography
The motion of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is often affected by unknown disturbances arising from underwater flow fields.
These disturbances may result in large prediction errors when comparing the AUV's expected surfacing location (for example from dead reckoning) and the AUV's measured
surfacing location (for example from GPS).
This error, referred to as the Motion Integration Error, has been used by Motion Tomography algorithm (MT) to reconstruct an estimate of the underwater flow field.
